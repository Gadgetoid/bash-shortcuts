### Overview
Hooks are a more complex way to run your shortcuts, and allow you to automate running shortcuts. By adding a hook to a shortcut, it will be run each time the hook's associated event occurs, and will be passed the arguments for the hook event.

### Hookable Events
Listed below are all the different hookable events. Each hook has a description of when it occurs, and what flag(s) it will provide your shortcut with. These flags can be accessed by checking for them in your script, as well as a flag containing the hook name.
