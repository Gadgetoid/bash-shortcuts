### Overview
Hooks are a more complex way to run your shortcuts, and allow you to automate running them. By adding a hook to a shortcut, it will be run each time the hook's associated event occurs, and will be passed the flags for the hook event (**IMPORTANT:** You need to turn on pass flags in the shortcut's settings, otherwise it will be given no flags).

<br/>

### Global Flags
There are a few flags that are passed to all non app shortcuts wthat take flags. These are:
| Flag   | Value     |
| :----: | :-------- |
| -t     | The time the shortcut was run at |
| -d     | The date the shortcut was run on |
| -u     | The username of the current user |

<br/>

### Current Game Flags
These flags are passed when you are on a game's library page or it is running. <br/>
**Note:** that these are not passed for game related hooks since those hooks set the same flags
| Flag   | Value     |
| :----: | :-------- |
| -i     | The current game's appId |
| -n     | The current game's name |

<br/>

### Hookable Events
Listed below are all the different hookable events. Each hook has a description of when it occurs, and what flag(s) it will provide your shortcut with (in addition to the global flags). These flags can be accessed by checking for them in your script, as well as a flag containing the hook name.
